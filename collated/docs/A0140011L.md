### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
*Figure 9: Class Diagram of Model component*

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/teamfour/tasc/model/Model.java)

The **`Model`**
* stores a `UserPref` object that contains the user's preferences.
* stores task list's data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
    * However, other components are heavily dependent on this component.
<br><br>

**`Model` Interface:**

The **`Model`** interface allows you to request for any model-related operations, such as retrieving and modifying tasks
in the task list, without having to know anything about the implementation of the `ModelManager` class.

**Notable APIs**

Return type | Method and Description
----------- | ----------------------
void | `resetData(ReadOnlyTaskList newData)`: Replaces the entire task list with the one provided by `newData`.
ReadOnlyTaskList | `getTaskList()`: Retrieves the entire task list.
void | `addTask(Task task)`: Adds a task to the list.
void | `updateTask(ReadOnlyTask oldTask, Task newTask)`: Updates the details of the old task with the new task given.
void | `deleteTask(ReadOnlyTask target)`: Deletes the `target` task.
void | `resetTaskListFilter()`: Resets all filters that was used to view only a certain subset of the task list.
<br>

**`ModelManager` Class:**

The `ModelManager` class implements the **`Model`** interface, and provides all the services and functionality
specifed in the **`Model`** interface.

Other components should reference this class indirectly by using the **`Model`** interface. You should not
directly use this class outside the model component.
<br><br>

**`ReadOnlyTaskList`, `ReadOnlyTask` Interfaces:**

These interfaces allow you to retrieve tasks, but not modify them. You can retrieve the tasks
and tags used in the entire task list.
<br><br>

**`TaskList` Class:**

The `TaskList` class is responsible for maintaining the task list required by the program. You should not call
any method of this class directly. Instead, you should request for retrieval and modification via the
`ModelManager`. The `ModelManager` will return a `ReadOnlyTaskList` when requesting for tasks in the task list.
<br><br>

**`Task` Class:**

The `Task` class contains all the task details. (e.g. name, deadlines, tags, ...)

For each individual detail, the class will always store a reference to an object. Therefore, even
if the detail for such task is blank (e.g. there is no deadline for a task), the reference to the
details is **never `null`**. Instead, a `Deadline()` will be created to represent that there is no
deadline for the task (usually, you would use `Deadline(Date date)` if the task has a deadline).
<br><br>

**`HistoryStack` and `HistoryItem<T>` Classes:**

The `HistoryStack` class stores the most recent states of the implemented `HistoryItem<T>` objects.
You can specify a maximum size for the stack, and older history states are discarded whenever new states are 
pushed and the size has exceeded the maximum size. History states stored in the stack are returned as type `T` objects when popped.

> **Note:** The `undo` and `redo` command uses HistoryStack to store recent states of the TaskList.<br>
> This design eliminates the need to implement an undo/redo method for every command.
> This saves time and effort for implementing new commands, and also reduces complications and potential bugs.

<br>

**`UserPrefs` Class:**

The `UserPrefs` class stores the program settings.

> **Note:** The program settings and user configuration settings are different.

<br>

**`Name`, `Complete`, `Deadline`, `Period`, `Recurrence`, `Tag` Classes:**

The classes mentioned represents the details of the task. Do note that some
classes have multiple constructors (for details that are not filled in, use the default constructor)

**Notable APIs**

Methods | Description
------- | -----------
Name(String name) | Name of the task
Complete(boolean complete) | Completion status of the task
Deadline(Date date) | The deadline for the task is `date`<br>*(Omit `date` for no deadline)*
Period(Date startTime, Date endTime) | The time slot for the task is `startTime` to `endTime`<br>*(Omit `startTime` and `endTime` for no period)*
Recurrence(Pattern type, int frequency) | The task repeats for `frequency` times, in a daily, weekly or monthly fashion<br>*(Omit `type` and `frequency` for no deadline)*
Tag(String name) | One of the tags for this task
<br>

**`UniqueTagList` Class:**

The `UniqueTagList` class stores the unique tag list for a task. It is guaranteed that there will
be no duplicate tags in the list.
<br><br>

**`UniqueTaskList` Class:**

The `UniqueTaskList` class provides a task list with no duplicate tasks.

#### Use case: Create new event

**MSS:**

1. User creates new task with start time and end time
2. Program creates the task with given start time and end time<br>
Use case ends

**Extensions:**

2a. The start time or end time given is invalid
> 2a1. Program shows an error message, prompts for re-type of task details<br>
> 2a2. User re-types the start time and end time<br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

2b. The start time is later than the end time
> 2b1. Program shows an error message, provides two options: Swap time around, or re-type task details<br>
>     * 2b1i. User requests to swap time around<br>
>           * Program swap time around<br>
>           * Use case resumes at step 3<br>
>     * 2b1ii. User requests to retype timing<br>
>           * Use case resumes at step 2a3

<br>

#### Use case: List uncompleted tasks

**MSS:**

1. User requests to list uncompleted tasks
2. Program lists uncompleted tasks, by order of tasks with earliest deadline<br>
Use case ends

**Extensions:**

1a. The list is empty
> 1a1. Program shows a notice message<br>
  Use case ends

#### Microsoft Outlook

Strengths:

* Can flag emails as task (i.e. Emails can be turned into tasks)
* Keyboard shortcuts discovery simple (hold Alt key and all keyboard shortcuts are shown)
* Allow tasks without specific time
* Can still work without internet, will sync back to the online server when internet connection is restored
* Can block multiple slots as having multiple appointments in a time slot is allowed (However it is not built-in feature, have to manually use tags)
* Task can be sorted in due date (to know which task needs to be completed first)
* Tasks can be recurring in nature (lecture quiz task only needs to be created one time, a reminder will pop up every week)
* Tasks can be marked as done
* Tasks can be set to different priorities (high/medium/low)
* You can indicate the amount of work done for the task (0% complete? 5% complete?)
* Tasks can be set with a reminder

Weaknesses:

* Tasks from emails cannot be renamed
* Cannot allocate task to a certain time slot in the calendar
* Keyboard shortcuts does not always make sense (sometimes it is the first letter of the name, sometimes it is the second letter, etc)
* Keyboard shortcuts too long winded sometimes
* Tasks only appear as a list in ‘Daliy Task List’ if you force it to appear in calendar view
* No sense of context awareness at all, no GCal’s quick add (e.g. if you type "Eat Cheese in NUS at 9am", it does not specify the location at NUS and the time is not set to 9am)
* No way to find suitable slots painlessly (no 'Find a Time' feature)
* A lot of mouse action required (while keyboard shortcuts, exist they are not designed with keyboard shortcuts in mind, but rather with a mouse user)
* Only one reminder can be created for each task

Summary:

While it provides recurring features, and seperates tasks and events, tasks are not shown on the calendar view, which
makes it hard to visualise the due dates of the tasks. The use of mouse is required for some features.

Our Program:

We will not only provide a good calendar UI for tasks, we will also strive to minimize mouse usage by allowing
user to access the commands by typing through the command box.

### Changing the details of a task/event: `update`

You have a list of tasks, and you realised that there is a typo in the name of the first task. You can correct the typo by typing:

`update 1 name "New Task Name"`

> **Note:**<br>
> The number used is relative to the position of the task in the list.

<br>
What if the deadline is wrong? You can change the deadline to 20 Sep by entering this:

`update 3 by 20 Sep`

Any other details of the tasks that you have added can be updated easily (see
the `add` command section to see the details that tasks can have).

<br>
Or you can add more tags to the task:

`update 4 tag "Low Priority"`

Or if the deadline is no longer valid, remove it by adding `remove` before the keyword `by`:

`update 5 removeby`

> **Tip:**<br>
> This works for any other keywords you may have used in your `add` command,
> like `removefrom`, `removeto`, `removerepeat`, `removetag` etc.

<br>
In general, you may use this format to update your tasks' various parameters.
`update INDEX [name NAME] [by DEADLINE] [from START_TIME to END_TIME] [repeat PATTERN FREQUENCY] [tag TAG...]`
 * INDEX refers to the task's index number as shown in the task list.
<br>

### Marking a task as complete: `complete`

Once you have completed a task, you can mark it as complete.

`complete 1`

<br><br>
In general, you may use this format to mark your tasks as complete.
`complete INDEX`
