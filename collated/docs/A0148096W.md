TaSc is a task manager for users to manage their schedules using only keyboard commands. Users can add and manipulate tasks and events. Users can schedule their tasks with deadlines and periods, and use tags to categorize them. TaSc is a desktop application written in Java, and its GUI is built using JavaFx.

This guide contains all necessary information for both new and experienced contributors to continue the development of TaSc. Each section provides an overview on a topic, which will then be explained in greater detail in the subsections. Each subsection is mostly self contained for ease of reference. Throughout your development of TaSc you may freely revisit the topics as and when you need to.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
*Figure 5: Class Diagram of UI component*

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/teamfour/tasc/ui/Ui.java)

*Figure 5* above shows the overview of the UI component. It consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, which includes `CommandBox`, `TaskListPanel`,
`CalendarPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
which can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The **`UI`** component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 which are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/teamfour/tasc/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)
<br><br>

The **`UI`** component
* executes user commands using the **`Logic`** component.
* binds itself to some data in the **`Model`** so that the UI can auto-update when data in the **`Model`** change.
* responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

<img src="images/UiComponentParts.png" width="480"><br>
*Figure 6. UI component in the application's interface*

*Figure 6* above shows where each `UiPart` is attached to the `MainWindow`.
<br><br>

**`TaskListPanel` Class:**

The `TaskListPanel` shows a list of `TaskCard` object, where each `TaskCard` contains the details of a task shown to the user. 
The `TaskCard` is also assigned a unique index in increasing order, which is used in other commands to identify a task, e.g. `delete 3` deletes the third item in the list.
<br><br>

**`CalendarPanel` Class:**

The `CalendarPanel` encapsulates the `Agenda` control from [`JFXtras`](http://jfxtras.org/doc/8.0/jfxtras-agenda/) library. 
The `CalendarPanel` handles the display and selection of tasks on the calendar, and also handles the switching between *Day* and *Week* view of the calendar.
<br><br>

**`HelpWindow` Class:**

The `HelpWindow` is a window separate from the `MainWindow`. It shows our product's User Guide using a WebBrowser which supports modern HTML and CSS.

#### Use case: Show all tasks with given conditions

**MSS:**

1. User requests to show all tasks with given conditions
2. Program lists the tasks which match all the given conditions in the specified order<br>
Use case ends

**Extensions:**

1a. The list is empty
> 1a1. Program shows a notice message<br>
  Use case ends

<br>

#### Use case: Find tasks using keywords

**MSS:**

1. User requests to find tasks by providing some keywords
2. Program lists the tasks whose information matches some of the keywords<br>
Use case ends

**Extensions:**

1a. The list is empty
> 1a1. Program shows a notice message<br>
  Use case ends

<br>

#### Use case: Delete all data

**MSS:**

1. User requests to delete all data
2. Program ask for user's confirmation
3. User confirms the deletion

#### Google Calendar

Strengths:

* Full-featured keyboard shortcuts
* Integrated with Gmail, requires just one-click to add event from inbox
* Offline support with Chrome
* Mini-calendar at sidebar
* Multiple calendar views (monthly/weekly/daily)
* Multiple calendars (can show/hide all)
* Email/Chrome/mobile notifications
* Syncs to cloud when online
* Has 'Find a time' feature
* Supports recurring events
* Drag and drop event from one day to another
* Import/Export iCal/CSV calendar for offline use

Weaknesses:

* Only color tags
* Keyboard shortcuts â€œhas to be discoveredâ€?
* Unable to delete/edit event using one command
* Unable to add floating tasks
* No tasks view with priority/deadlines
* Unable to reserve multiple slots
* Unable to mark event with statuses such as 'completed', 'canceled'

Summary:

The calendar view is a useful feature to help users visualize their schedules. On the other hand,
the lack of ability to add floating tasks may cause inconvenience to users.

Our Program:

We will allow tasks with no deadlines and time slots (periods).

### Listing all tasks/events with specified conditions: `list`

You may have a lot of tasks in your task list after using TaSc for a
certain amount of time. The `list` command allows you to filter your tasks in the list.

First of all, if you just want to see a list of uncompleted tasks and upcoming
events, just type:

`list`

> **Note:**<br>
> For your convenience, this command automatically sorts the tasks by their dates `earliest first`.

<br>
You may want to view tasks that happen during certain periods:

`list from 18 Sep 1pm to 6pm`

<br>
You may also want to view tasks that need to be done by a certain time
and require your attention:

`list by 20 Sep`

<br>
You may also list category of tasks:

`list tag "Submissions"`

<br>
What about tasks with no deadlines and periods? They are known as
*floating* tasks, and you can list them using:

`list floating tasks`

> **Tip:**<br>
> The available types are:
> `all`, `uncompleted`, `completed`, `period`, `deadline`, `overdue`, `floating`, `recurring`, `events`, `tasks`, and `free time`.
<br>

You can use a combination of the types:

`list floating tasks completed`

<br>
Finally, if you need to sort your tasks, enter the following:

`list sort earliest first`

> **Tip:**<br>
> Sorting order includes `earliest first`, `latest first` for date and time,
  and `a-z`, `z-a` for task descriptions.

<br>

<br><br>

<img src="images/Ui-List2.png" width="600"><br>
*Figure 4b: The `list` command allows you to filter your tasks easily.*
<br><br>

In general, you may use this format to list tasks with various filters<br>
`list [TYPE...] [by DEADLINE] [from START_TIME] [to END_TIME] [tag TAG...] [sort SORTING_ORDER]`

### Narrowing listing results with specified type, date or tags: `show`

Already typed your list command, only to find out that you have more filters
to add? Don't retype your `list` command, simply use the `show` command
to further narrow your task list results.

For example, you may want to list out the uncompleted tasks, so you typed this:

`list uncompleted tasks`

However, you realise that only want to see those for your module CS2103. Instead of typing
the entire `list` command again (`list uncompleted tasks tag "CS2103"`),
enter this instead:

`show tag "CS2103"`

> **Tip:**<br>
> Because this is an extension of the `list` command, any parameters that is
> accepted by the `list` command is also accepted by the `show` command.
<br><br>

In general, you may use this format to show various tasks from the tasks listed.<br>
`show [TYPE...] [on DATE] [by DEADLINE] [from START_TIME] [to END_TIME] [tag TAG...]`

<br>

### Hiding listing results with specified type, date or tags: `hide`

Similar to `show`, you may want to `hide` some tasks instead.

To list every uncompleted tasks **except** for those tagged as "CS2103", enter these:

`list uncompleted tasks`<br>
`hide tag "CS2103"`
<br>

In general, you may use this format to hide various tasks from the tasks listed.<br>
`hide [TYPE...] [on DATE] [by DEADLINE] [from START_TIME] [to END_TIME] [tag TAG...]`

<br>

###  Undoing the last action: `undo`

Mistakes in TaSc have very little consequence. You can easily undo any previous action which
modified the task list (for example, deleting a task):

`undo`

<br>
You can undo the last *X* number of actions. For example, to undo the
last 5 actions taken:

`undo 5`

> **Note:**<br>
> Sorry! To help you save memory on your computer, 
> you can only undo up to the 10 most recent tasks.

<br>
In general, you may use this format to undo various number of changes.
`undo [LAST STEPS]`
 * LAST STEPS refer to the number of steps to undo, starting from the lastest step. 

If you simply type:
`undo`
, the last step will be undone.

### Changing calendar view: `calendar`

Sometimes, you may want to focus on your day, and find the calendar too cluttered. We can fix that for you, just type:

`calendar day`

You can switch back to the week view by typing:

`calendar week`
<br><br>

```
